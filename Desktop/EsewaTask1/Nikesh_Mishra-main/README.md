# Task 0: Collaborative Code Review Workflow for Java Basics

## Problem Statement:
Your team is working on a collaborative project to reinforce the understanding of basic Java programming concepts. Each team member is assigned a specific aspect to implement and document. The task is to simulate a collaborative code review workflow for these Java basics using Git.

## Instructions:

### Repository Setup:
- Initialize a new Git repository named "knowing-my-friends-java-and-git"
- Create a README.md file with a brief description of the project and a table of contents for the assigned tasks.
- `All of the above is already done. Just take a fork and clone the repository to your local.`

### Branching:
- Each team member should create a new branch named after the assigned task (issue) with your first name (e.g., `syntax-task-satya`, `variables-task-saugat`).
- Implement the assigned task in the branch, including proper documentation.

### Commits:
- Make at least three meaningful commits within the branch, incorporating iterative changes or improvements for the assigned task.
- Tag / mention the issue by `#issue_no` in each commit message (eg. `Implement basic Java syntax (#1)`).

### Pull Request:
- Initiate a pull request (PR) for the task branch.
- Add detailed information about the task implementation and documentation in the PR description.

### Code Review:
- Assign another team member to review the pull request for the task.
- The reviewer should provide constructive feedback on the task implementation and documentation within the PR comments.
- There must be at least 3 code reviews on each PR.

### Iterative Development:
- Based on the feedback received, make necessary adjustments and additional commits within the task branch.

### Merging:
- After the code review is complete and there are no blocking issues, assign back the issue to me (Satya) by changing the label of the issue to `ready-to-merge`. I will merge the task branch into the main branch.

### Conflict Resolution (Optional):
- Introduce a simulated conflict by having two team members make conflicting changes in separate task branches.
- Resolve the conflict using Git and document the resolution process.

### Branch Deletion:
- After successful merging, delete the task branch.

### Final Repository State:
- Ensure that the main branch contains your task implementations merged.
